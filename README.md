## About the theme

`hyper-oh-my-zsh` is a [z shell](http://www.zsh.org/) theme designed to complement a git-focused workflow based on `Hyper` default terminal theme. It gives you a comprehensive overview of the branch you're working on and the status of your repository throughout the development process without cluttering your terminal.  

It currently shows (in order of the prompt):  
- Current working directory
- Git branch
- Exit code of last command
- Time since last commit
- Git status
- Background Jobs


## Installation

If you're using `oh-my-zsh`, you need to make sure that you have the a `themes` folder inside the oh-my-zsh `custom` folder and you're using the new theme üéâ üéâ üéâ üéâ

To install this theme, open your terminal and paste this command into your command line.

```bash
mkdir -p $ZSH_CUSTOM/themes && wget -O $ZSH_CUSTOM/themes/hyper-oh-my-zsh.zsh-theme https://raw.githubusercontent.com/willmendesneto/hyper-oh-my-zsh/master/hyper-oh-my-zsh.zsh-theme
```

After that, open your `~/.zshrc` file in your prefered code/text editor and set `ZSH_THEME="current_theme"` to `ZSH_THEME="hyper-oh-my-zsh"`. And when you reload your command line it's done! üëèüëèüëè
